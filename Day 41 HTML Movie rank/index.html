 <h2>Top 3 Best Movies OATðŸ˜¤</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The Karate Kid Series</h3>
 <p>Self explanatory. The action and story behind it was amazing, and as a Cobra Kai fan, 
    it helped me understand the lore and why the resurgence of some of these characters was so scary/suprising.
    Great movie series basically. A young king from New Jersey moves to Encino, California, and gets taught karate by a 
    mechanic to fend off his bullies. That's crazy!</p>

<h3>Rocky 1-4</h3>
<p>Watched these after I watched the Karate Kid Series. Classic American Movie, my favorite was actually Rocky III, but Rocky IV isn't bad or nothing. 
    They are tied for first is a more accurate representation. An amateur Boxer from Philadelphia turns away from his life of assisting
    loan sharks with BRUTE FORCE (oooooohðŸ˜±), and uses that energy in the ring to fight and win against many opponents. His opponents
    were usually the better fighters, but his sheer grit and determination had him win. (#PlotArmor?)

<h3>Inside Story</h3>
<p>This movie about a fictional Kenyan footballer named Kalu, documented his journey climbing the ranks as a football player with HIV!
    He went through lots, and one of his closest friends (who was formerly his enemy) supported him while sick with the disease himself, as Kalu
    went on to score a winning bicycle-kick goal on TV and win his former team a championship. I loved the movie, and it was interesting.
